# resturant-page

## Overview:
This is another project from TOP curriculum it is aout a resturant website that has three pages home page, menu page and contact page. The menu page contains a list of multiple different German dishes, each dish can be clicked to show a brief description of the dish and it's price.

The main purpose of this project is to practice using ES6 modules and multiple tools like npm to install different packages and webpack to bundle multiple JS modules into one file that is compatible with the browser. I also got a better understanding of how should the project be structured and designed in a way that keep everything flexible and loosly attached to other components of the project.

## What I learned:
- How to properly structure the files of the project.
- How to use npm to install and unstall different packages.
- What is the purpose of package.json file.
- What are source maps and how to use them.
- How to use webpack-dev-server to automatically compile the code whenever it changes.
- How to load different assets (like CSS files and images) from within JS module.
- How to import and export JS modules.
- How to disable and enable a specific stylesheet when a specific event is fired.
